# XML_Database_Modeling

Modeling of an XML database to store the data of a tour operator. 

You should distinguish among different kinds of tourism: cultural tourism, adventure, ecotourims, etc. You should model the various aspects of a tour operator: destinations, activities, tours, clients, guides, etc.

1. Describe your modeling choices in natural language. Think about the advantages and disadvantages of your choices and discuss them.
2. Write an XML Schema that represents your modeling
3. Write a valid XML database against this model, containing a representative extract of the data of some tour operator.
4. Imagine 3 different scenarios requiring the visualization of part of this data and write 3 XSL stylesheets to answer them.
5. Imagine a 4th scenario requiring the exploitation of part of this data in another XML format and write a stylesheet for this.
6. Bonus: Imagine a 5th scenario requiring the exploitation of part of this data in JSON format and write a stylesheet for this.
7. optional (bonus): the JSON Schema of the 5th output
